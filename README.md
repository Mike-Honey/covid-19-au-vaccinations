## Reference:

Data on Australian Vaccinations and other covid-19 statistics from [covidlive.com.au](https://covidlive.com.au/report/vaccinations-people).  This is the source for Australian numbers presented in [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/). Unfortunately concise government sources are not available, so there is a significant citizen data science effort to collate these figures in a consistent way.

Data on Australian Population from [abs.gov.au](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/national-state-and-territory-population/sep-2020). Summarised population is unsuitable as their bands of age ranges do not align with the "Adult = 16+" definition used by Health Departments. So the method used is to get the most detailed time series spreadsheets, e.g. "Population - Victoria". Each column represents a single year age, by Gender.  The columns for "Persons" Gender are selected. "Adult" is derived by summing the columns for ages 16+ (note: split across 2 sheets). The latest row available (dated June 2020) is selected.

Infographic was inspired by the visualisation design of [Marta Fioni](https://twitter.com/martafioni), as featured on the [UK government "equivalent" dashboard](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/).

The cases, deaths, tesing, vaccinations analyses were inspired by the visualisation design of [John Burn-Murdoch](https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch), as featured in the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/fa4f248a-a476-491d-a5ce-f128360e9f24).

The Cases, hospitalisation, ICU, deaths analysis was inspired by the visualisation design of [Louis Rossouw](https://twitter.com/lrossouw/status/1517260154491781123?s=20&t=VS_5aQlDK7yRLL0CuxQKAg).

The Cases and hospitalisation vs CDC Community Levels analysis compares case and hospitalisation rates with [Community Levels set by the US CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html). 

The first metric they look at is "Cases per 100,000 people for the past 7 days", being fewer than or more than 200.  All regions of Australia have been well over that mark for the Omicron outbreak. So I'm focussing on the last 2 rows in the CDC table.

Their next metric is Admissions per 100K (7-day total). Australia doesn't publish that data, but you can see from the first 2 charts on this OWID page the "in Hospital" numbers are a very close proxy, for the US and other comparable countries. https://ourworldindata.org/covid-hospitalizations

The last CDC metric is % of staffed inpatient beds occupied.  I don't have data on hand for that for Australia. But as Australia is well into the "High" zone on the first 2 indicators, and the CDC instruction is "Use the Highest Level that applies", that metric is not needed.

## Summary

The cases, deaths, Reff snapshot page compresses the recent trends on cases and deaths into a dense infographic. The latest number in each category (by Geography) is supported by a sparkline to show the recent trends.

Reff is calculated following the parameters used by [Professor Adrian Esterman](https://twitter.com/profesterman/status/1479226466181484544?s=20&t=ZJ7rvC2JPQjvpBCeGn_KKA) - first smooth the daily cases using a 7-day average, then divide the latest day's cases (7-day avg) by the cases (7-day avg) from 4 days prior. It shows the momentum in the rise of fall of cases, with a Reff of 1.0 meaning cases are neither declining nor falling. 

The Statistics by Geography page shows a time series chart with a line for each Geography (states & territories, plus the national aggregate). A wide range of statistics are available, covering cases, hospitalisations, ICU, deaths, testing, vaccinations. I favour ratios per X population for comparison of the Geographies, as their population varies widely. The raw numbers are also available. You can choose which Geographies to include, and the time period.

The cases, deaths, tesing, vaccinations pages contrasts two key statistics - Cases vs Deaths. Testing % positive is shown as this informs the understanding of reported cases - when % positive is high, the true infection count is much higher than reported cases. Vaccinations are reported as % of the population (outcomes perspective, not work done).

The Cases, hospitalisation, ICU, deaths analysis page shows multiple key statistics as time-series on a single line chart. A log-scale Y-Axis helps comparison of growth for metrics that are at widely varying scales. Testing % positive is shown as this informs the understanding of reported cases - when % positive is high, the true infection count is much higher than reported cases. 

The infographic seeks to boil down the many figures on vaccinations into an easily digested picture. I'd been looking for inspiration on this for quite a while - the key questions in my mind are:
- How many people are protected?
- How many to go?

The "waffle chart" visual chosen by Marta presents the vaccination data, standardised by the population of various Geographies.  Geographies of wildly differing populations (e.g. New South Wales vs Tasmania) can be easily compared.

The data is presented in an interactive data visualisation tool: [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). This allows interactive filtering of the data (e.g. by Geography or Date), and includes supporting charts and data tables.  

The dataviz is refreshed automatically, roughly every 2 hours during the daytime (AEST GMT+10). 

I have a similar projects running for other countries globally:

THIS REPORT IS NOT HEALTH ADVICE - REFER TO YOUR LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITY.

Note: Prior to 1 June 2021, the figure shown for % 1st dose (and the pale green boxes representing that figure) were overstated - I misunderstood the meaning of the total 1st dose count as excluding people who received a 2nd dose, when in fact they are included.
