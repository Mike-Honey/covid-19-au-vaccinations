DataViz on Australian Vaccinations for COVID-19

**Reference:**

Data on Australian Vaccinations from [covidlive.com.au](https://covidlive.com.au/report/vaccinations-people).

Data on Australian Population from [abs.gov.au](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/national-state-and-territory-population/sep-2020).

Following the visualisation style of [Andrew L. Croxford](https://twitter.com/andrew_croxford/status/1395427955535450117?s=20).

**Summary**

This project seeks to boil down the many figures on vaccinations into an easily digested infographic. I've been looking for inspiration on this for quite a while - the key questions in my mind are:
- How many people are protected?
- How many to go?

The "waffle chart" visual chosen by Andrew presents the vaccination data standardised by the population of various Geographies. 

Data transparency on Vaccinations has not lived up to the announcements - reporting is patchy and 

The data is presented in an interactive data visualisation tool: [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). This allows interactive filtering of the data (e.g. by Geography).
